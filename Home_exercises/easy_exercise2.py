# Ask the user for a sentence using the input() function.
# Use string manipulation functions to convert the sentence to title case (where the first letter of each word is capitalized). Print the new sentence.
# Ask the user for their age using the input() function.
# Use conditional statements to check if the user is old enough to vote (18 years or older). 
# If they are, use printf-style formatting to print a # message that congratulates them on their right to vote. 
# If they are not, use printf-style formatting to print a message that encourages them to come # back when they are older. 
# The messages should be formatted like this: "Congratulations, [name]! You have the right to vote." and "Sorry, [name], # you're not old enough to vote yet. 
# Come back in [years_until_voting] years."
